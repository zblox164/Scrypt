# Scrypt
Current version 0.0.61-alpha

## What is Scrypt?
Scrypt is a lightweight Roblox development framework. Scrypt aims to be an easy-to-use framework to power your Roblox projects! It includes several feature to improve your workflow over vanilla Luau. Those include:
* Lazily loaded modules
* Built in networking
* Support for three types of modules (Services, Controllers, Shared modules)
* Built-in Utilities (Custom events and functions, roblox service access, and more)
* Easy Gui access

Scrypt is planned on being supported for many years to come and much more is planned to be added!

### Future Plans / Roadmap
Currently, there is no official roadmap for Scrypt. There are features that are being planned but the timeline on the implementation is not set. One of the main features that is planned is optimized network communication. As of version 0.0.61-alpha, there is no performance benefit to using the built-in networking systems vs just using remote events or remote functions.

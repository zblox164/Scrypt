The reason for the naming changes is I wanted to keep naming consistent across the framework. The function changes were: ServerNetwork​ Scrypt.ServerNetwork.Listen -- NEWScrypt.ServerNetwork.ListenForRequest -- NEWScrypt.ServerNetwork.ListenForRequestPacket -- RENAMED FROM 'ListenForRequest' ClientNetwork​ Scrypt.ClientNetwork.Listen -- NEWScrypt.ClientNetwork.Request -- RENAMED FROM 'EmptyRequest' Since I added the new 'Listen' functions, I felt the naming of 'EmptyRequest' needed to be changed as well (I didn't want to name 'Listen', 'EmptyListen'). This hopefully will be a one time thing that will not need to be changed again. Since Scrypt is early in development, I want to get the naming consistent now so that in the future, especially if there are more users, it won't be an issue. As for the removal of the RegEx and Promise, I wanted to keep Scrypt lightweight and not require any third party modules that are required for the framework to work.","keywords":"","version":null},{"title":"About","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/Scrypt/docs/About","content":"","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"What is Scrypt?​","type":1,"pageTitle":"About","url":"/Scrypt/docs/About#what-is-scrypt","content":" Scrypt is a lightweight Roblox development framework.

While the basic usage of Scrypt is not purely functional, its internals were built using strong functional foundations and encourages developers to use functional programming in their services and controllers as much as possible. Scrypt also includes a small bulit-in Utils library which contains some common pure functions:  FilterMapReduce  Functional programming is what is known as a programming paradigm. A paradigm controls the structure or 'style' of how code is written. Some common paradigms include: object-oriented, imperative, procedural, and of course, functional. The functional paradigm has a few main properties that define what it exactly is. If you want to go in depth on what these are, you can look further into it but the main pillars of functional programming are:  Data is immutableFunctions are pureHigher order and first class functionsReduced (or no) side effects  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Future Plans / Roadmap​","type":1,"pageTitle":"About","url":"/Scrypt/docs/About#future-plans--roadmap","content":" Currently, there is no official roadmap for Scrypt.

To start the installation process, you'll first need to get the Scrypt framework. Currently, there are two methods to do this:  Download the .rbxm file as provided in the GitHub repositoryGet Scrypt directly from the Creator Store  Method 1​  Go to the main branch of the official Scrypt repository and download the .rbxm file named 'ScryptModel'. Once you have downloaded the model, simply drag it into your studio session.  Method 2​  If you opt for the second method, you can find Scrypt on the Creator Store here. You should be able to add the framework to your inventory and import it through the toolbox afterwards.    Once you've imported Scrypt into your project, you can begin the next step. Scrypt should come with a root folder that contains several items, each needs to be moved:  Scrypt module -&gt; game/ReplicatedStorageControllers folder -&gt; game/ReplicatedStorageShared folder -&gt; game/ReplicatedStorageServices folder -&gt; game/ServerScriptService  After you've moved all the framework components to the proper locations, you can begin using the framework.

This function returns the instance object when it replicates. This only happens when the instance is nil on the client so it is advised to check if the instance exists before running this method. --@server -- Data to client Scrypt.Services.Players.PlayerAdded:Connect(function(Player: Player) local NewPart = Instance.new(&quot;Part&quot;) NewPart.Name = &quot;SendFromServer&quot; NewPart.Parent = workspace local Packet = { Data = NewPart, Reliable = true, Address = Player }:: Scrypt.ServerPacketData Scrypt.ServerNetwork.SendPacketToClient(&quot;Receive&quot;, Packet) end) --@client -- From Server local FromServer FromServer = Scrypt.ClientNetwork.ListenForPacket(&quot;Receive&quot;, true, function(SentInstance) local Object = SentInstance:Replicate() print(Object.Name) -&gt; 'SentFromServer' end)   ","version":"Next","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"require() Replacement​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Getting Started","url":"/Scrypt/docs/intro#require-replacement","content":" So far, the examples have only shown the built in features of Scrypt. You might be asking yourself, &quot;how can I build a game with this?&quot;. The answer is you can use Scrypt to lazily load game modules for you. To utilize this, create a new ModuleScript under ReplicatedStorage/Shared/Modules. You can make this module contain whatever you want. For now, let's just use this as an example:  --!strict --@shared local BasicMath = {} function BasicMath.Add(a: number, b: number): number return a + b end function BasicMath.Subtract(a: number, b: number): number return a - b end function BasicMath.Multiply(a: number, b: number): number return a * b end function BasicMath.Divide(a: number, b: number): number return a / b end return BasicMath   To access this module from other scripts, normally you have to reference the module and then require it to use it. With Scrypt, all you have to do, is run the GetModule function with name of the module passed as an argument. In this case, the module is named &quot;BasicMath&quot;. In a test script, we can access it with:  local Scrypt = require(game:GetService(&quot;ReplicatedStorage&quot;).Scrypt) Scrypt.Init():Wait() local BasicMath = Scrypt.GetModule(&quot;BasicMath&quot;) print(BasicMath.Add(64, 100)) --&gt; 164 print(BasicMath.Subtract(228, 64)) --&gt; 164 print(BasicMath.Multiply(1, 164)) --&gt; 164 print(BasicMath.Divide(328, 2)) --&gt; 164   You don't only have to place your game modules in the Shared/Modules folder. Scrypt loads modules from all of the following locations by default, each with their own purpose:  ReplicatedStorage/Shared/Modules (Server &amp; Client) Modules that are used with both the server and client ReplicatedStorage/Shared/Libraries (Server &amp; Client) Modules that contain specific functions for a specific purpose. For example, a custom quaternion library. ServerScriptService/Services (Server) Game service modules (Services docs). ReplicatedStorage/Controllers (Client) Game controller modules (Controller docs).  tip All modules are lazily loaded! This means modules are only loaded when they are needed instead of all of your scripts being loaded at runtime. Services and Controllers have their own 'Get' functions. See the API or specific doc pages for more details.  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"GUI Interaction​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Getting Started","url":"/Scrypt/docs/intro#gui-interaction","content":" Scrypt allows for easy access to your UI elements through the use of the Scrypt.GUI property. This property returns a lazily loaded dictionary of all of your UI elements. Since this table is lazily loaded, if you try to print out the elements stored in the GUI property, you'll simply be returned an empty table. Elements are only returned when indexed. For example, if you had a ScreenGui in StarterGui with a frame as a child, if you index Scrypt.GUI.ScreenGui, the GUI table would return:  { [&quot;Frame&quot;] = Frame, [&quot;Root&quot;] = ScreenGui }   Notice how this does not return the ScreenGui object, but rather a dictionary of the immediate children of that ScreenGui as well as a Root key to easily access the ScreenGui. If you are trying to access the Frame, you can index it by name. For any children under the Frame, you can access them through any regular method (dot notation, FindFirstChild, etc...) as you now have a reference to the Frame object and not a dictionary.

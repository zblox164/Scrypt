        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the latest update, there were some changes to existing network functions as well as the removal of some third party modules. The reason for the naming changes is I wanted to keep naming consistent across the framework.</p>
<p>The function changes were:</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="servernetwork">ServerNetwork<a href="https://zblox164.github.io/Scrypt/blog/2025/08/05/Recent%20Update%20Changes#servernetwork" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to ServerNetwork" title="Direct link to ServerNetwork">​</a></h4>
<ul>
<li><code>Scrypt.ServerNetwork.Listen</code> -- NEW</li>
<li><code>Scrypt.ServerNetwork.ListenForRequest</code> -- NEW</li>
<li><code>Scrypt.ServerNetwork.ListenForRequestPacket</code> -- RENAMED FROM 'ListenForRequest'</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="clientnetwork">ClientNetwork<a href="https://zblox164.github.io/Scrypt/blog/2025/08/05/Recent%20Update%20Changes#clientnetwork" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to ClientNetwork" title="Direct link to ClientNetwork">​</a></h4>
<ul>
<li><code>Scrypt.ClientNetwork.Listen</code> -- NEW</li>
<li><code>Scrypt.ClientNetwork.Request</code> -- RENAMED FROM 'EmptyRequest'</li>
</ul>
<p>Since I added the new 'Listen' functions, I felt the naming of 'EmptyRequest' needed to be changed as well (I didn't want to name 'Listen', 'EmptyListen'). This hopefully will be a one time thing that will not need to be changed again. Since Scrypt is early in development, I want to get the naming consistent now so that in the future, especially if there are more users, it won't be an issue.</p>
<p>As for the removal of the RegEx and Promise, I wanted to keep Scrypt lightweight and not require any third party modules that are required for the framework to work.</p>]]></content>

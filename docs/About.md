## What is Scrypt?
Scrypt is a lightweight Roblox development framework. Scrypt aims to be an easy-to-use framework to power your Roblox projects! It includes several feature to improve your workflow over vanilla Luau. Those include:

* Lazily loaded modules
* Built in networking
* Support for three types of modules (Services, Controllers, Shared modules)
* Built-in Utilities (Custom events and functions, roblox service access, and more)

Scrypt is planned on being supported for many years to come and much more is planned to be added!

### Functional Programming

Scrypt also aims to promote functional programming. While the basic usage of Scrypt is not purely functional, its internals were built using strong functional foundations and encourages developers to use functional programming in their services and controllers as much as possible. Scrypt also includes a small bulit-in Utils library which contains some common pure functions:

* Filter
* Map
* Reduce

Functional programming is what is known as a programming paradigm. A paradigm controls the structure or 'style' of how code is written. Some common paradigms include: object-oriented, imperative, procedural, and of course, functional. The functional paradigm has a few main properties that define what it exactly is. If you want to go in depth on what these are, you can look further into it but the main pillars of functional programming are:

* Data is immutable
* Functions are pure
* Higher order and first class functions
* Reduced (or no) side effects

More coming soon!
